Containers offer a logical packaging mechanism in which applications can be abstracted from the environment in which they actually run. This decoupling allows container-based applications to be deployed easily and consistently, regardless of whether the target environment is a private data center, the public cloud, or even a developerâ€™s personal laptop. This gives developers the ability to create predictable environments that are isolated from the rest of the applications and can be run anywhere.

## Task
Let's open the `Dockerfile`{{open}} and take a look at whats going on. It's a rather simple Dockerfile in that it simply:
1. Pulls down the openjdk base image
2. Copies our current directory into /app on the container
3. Sets a working dir to /app
4. Makes the gradle wrapper executable
5. Runs a few gradle tasks that generate a jar file
6. Moves that jar file
7. Finally, execute the jar file

## Task
Our first task will be to build the docker image based off of our Dockerfile. In order to do this, we call upon the ```docker build``` command. We will also pass in an argument of ```-t``` to tag the image and a ```.``` to use the current directory as the build context. This may take a minute or two to complete. 

`docker build -t javaspring-docker .`{{execute T1}}

## Task
Now that we have the docker container built it's time to try and run the docker image. In order to do this, we will call the ```docker run``` command. We will also pass in an argument of ```-p``` to specify which ports will be exposed, as well as the image we created in the previous task  ```javaspring-docker```. It's done when you see ```welcomePageHandlerMapping``` 

`docker run -p 8080:8080 javaspring-docker`{{execute T1}}

## Task 
Now that we have a running container let's try and hit our endpoint. Clicking the below command will open up a new terminal to perform the curl. 

`curl localhost:8080`{{execute T3}}

We should see the output ```Greetings from Spring Boot!```.
`echo Click Here to send ctrl-alt-del to Terminal 1`{{execute interrupt T1}}

## Task
Let's tidy up after ourselves so that we don't leave any orphaned containers. The following commands will remove the containers and the images. 

`docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)`{{execute T1}}
`docker rmi -f javaspring-docker`{{execute T1}}
